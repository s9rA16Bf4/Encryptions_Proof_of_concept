# Color encryption
Encrypt messages in plainsight by combining letters with different colors of pixels!<br/>
It's now possible to use an image and encrypt a message into it!

## Where to begin?
Take a look at the Wiki to see some guidance on how the program works

## Installation
It's important that you have `Pillow` installed, the program will not work otherwise! Pillow can be installed through `pip` and or your package manager

## Example

![Example 1](https://github.com/s9rA16Bf4/colorEncryption/blob/master/pictures/1594210318_1411_08072020_1366x768.png) This is how "hello world" could look like. The structure is always the same but the generated pixels are random

![Example 2](https://github.com/s9rA16Bf4/colorEncryption/blob/master/pictures/1594203312_1215_08072020_1366x768.png) Same message as before, but this time all the other pixels also have a random color based upon the encryption table being used.

![Example 3](https://github.com/s9rA16Bf4/colorEncryption/blob/master/pictures/1594210467_1414_08072020_1366x768.png) This image contains the word "hello" but with the pod (pixel of data) set to 4. This means that every part of the message is 4 pixels away from eachother

![Example 4](https://github.com/s9rA16Bf4/colorEncryption/blob/master/pictures/1594209552_1359_08072020_1366x768.png) And this is the same message as before, the same pod but with the addition that the rest of the pixels consist of random colors
